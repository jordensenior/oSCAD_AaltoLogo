# oSCAD_AaltoLogo
3D printing is taking off at Aalto, and so too must our branding.

## How it works
Taking the logo generator for Aalto University at http://materialbank.aalto.fi (also where one can find a copy of the visual design guidelines), and tracing to DXF with Autocad, because Inkscape is too cumbersome and Aalto doesn't believe in vector format imags, the script should be pretty self explanitory.
